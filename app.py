    Twisted implements network protocol parsing and handling for TCP servers via twisted.internet.protocol.Protocol.

    is finished.This means that persistent configuration is not saved in the Protocol

    The protocol responds to events as they arrive from the network and the events arrive as calls to methods on the protocol.
